I have only had one off experience. That was on Halloween evening two years ago. Food trays were not filled well and they didn't seem to be refilling anything. There were only a few people there that evening. I feel they didn't expect many customers since it was Halloween and they were not prepared. What food was out was not as good as normal. Other occasions that I've eaten there I have enjoyed it very much. Just don't go on a night like Halloween.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
